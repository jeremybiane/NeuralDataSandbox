# NeuralDataSandbox
For exploring analysis notebooks  
Many notebooks call other notebooks, and all rely on variables defined in 'preprocessing' notebook  
Also including sample datasets from CNMFe output.  
*C.txt* = denoised trace (the red trace)  
*C_raw.txt* = raw trace (the blue trace)  
*S.txt* = spiking events deconvolved from traces  
*A.txt* = spatial footprints of ROIs  
*behavior_codes* = behavior file (arduino output containing timestamps of when behavioral (licks) and sensory (odor, sucrose deliveries) events occured  
*tseries.xml* = imaging file with timestamps of images
